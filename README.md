##I made an Ebay Scraper    
To use: download the ebay.py and change the keyword to whatever good you would search in the ebay search bar, if there is a space use + for each space.   
My search term is 'computer case' because I asked my Dad what he wanted off of Ebay and he said probably a computer case. You can replace the term with any other words though for the keywords variable in the python file and it still works.
